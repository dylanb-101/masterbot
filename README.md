# masterbot
This is my first real js project just adding anything I want to work on/fiddle with or I think is useful to me or the servers that I use the bot in if u have an requests on what I should add u can make an issue

let featuresSoFar =
- really basic eccoonmy system
    - mainly for fiddling with mongo DB
- set the status of the bot with a command
- audit log for all the messages sent in a server
- instant ratio for certain people in a server
- auto unban for certain users (only in one server)
- music bot because youtube took down all the other ones :/

let featuresInProgress = 
- run commands on the pi the server is hosted on through the bot (kind like ssh but through discord)
- not really a feature of the bot but i want to add a way for people to make their own mix and match discord bot with features and then they can download it themseleves and just run it themselves all with pre made commands and stuff
